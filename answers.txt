1. A number and a string are two different types of data. You cannot "add" the number to 
the string. They have to be combined through concatenation since they are two different types 
of primitives.

2. If your code is trying to determine if "12345" == 12345 and returns true when the first
 was input by the user as a string, but your code is reading it as a number.

3. Increment and decrement are sometimes confusing to me when you have to run them differently than with other operators. 
    Example taken from JavaScript 7 Syntax and Operators:
    
    function mathSample () {
        let price = 200;
        let result = 0;
    
        result = price++;
        console.log("result = price ++ =  " + result.toString());
        console.log("price = " + price.toString());
        result = ++price;
        console.log("result = ++price =  " + result.toString());

4. The modulus operator is useful when you need only even or odd numbers. You could use
an if/then or if/else expression using the modulus operator followed by the number 2 to 
identify an array of even or odd numbers within a range. You could use 0 as your value if 
you were looking for evens, and 1 as your value if looking for odd numbers.
